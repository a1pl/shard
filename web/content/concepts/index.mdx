# Core Concepts

Shard is built around a few key concepts that make it different from other launchers.

## The Flow

```
Profile (manifest) → Content Store (blobs) → Instance (game dir) → Launch
```

1. **Profiles** define what you want: Minecraft version, loader, mods
2. The **Content Store** holds the actual files, deduplicated by hash
3. **Instances** are materialized game directories, ready to run
4. **Launch** starts Minecraft with the right arguments

## Declarative vs Imperative

Traditional launchers are imperative: you click buttons to install mods, and the launcher modifies state directly. If something breaks, it's hard to know what changed.

Shard is declarative: your profile is a manifest that describes the desired state. The launcher materializes instances from this manifest. If something breaks, you can inspect the manifest or reset to a known state.

## Content-Addressed Storage

Every file in the content store is named by its SHA-256 hash:

```
~/.shard/store/mods/sha256/a3f2e1d4...
```

This means:
- **No duplicates**: Same file = same hash = stored once
- **Integrity**: If the hash matches, the content is correct
- **Easy cleanup**: Remove unreferenced blobs safely

## Separation of Concerns

Shard separates:
- **Profiles**: What you want (the manifest)
- **Content**: What exists (the blobs)
- **Instances**: What runs (the game dir)
- **Minecraft data**: Versions, libraries, assets (shared)

This separation makes Shard predictable and scriptable.
